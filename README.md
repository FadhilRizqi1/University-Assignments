## About the Repository

This repository is a structured compilation of practical exercises, weekly assignments, and significant projects completed as part of my university curriculum, specifically focusing on the 3rd and 4th semesters. It reflects my journey in learning and applying concepts across different fields such as server-side scripting with PHP, database management with MySQL, front-end development with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, software development methodologies, and machine learning algorithms. The aim is to demonstrate my understanding of core principles and problem-solving skills through hands-on implementation in various academic contexts.

## General Setup Instructions

To run the web-based projects locally, you will generally need a web server environment with PHP and MySQL support (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP). For Artificial Intelligence projects, a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook and relevant libraries is required. Please refer to the specific README files for detailed setup instructions for each project.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FadhilRizqi1/Lecture-Assignments.git
    cd <your repository name>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the specific project folder** and follow its `README.md` for detailed setup instructions.
